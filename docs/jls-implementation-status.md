# JLS Implementation Status

This document tracks which parts of the Java Language Specification (JLS, Java SE 21 edition) are implemented, partially implemented, or not yet implemented in java-analyzer.

Legend:
- **Done** — implemented and tested
- **Partial** — implemented with known gaps or caveats
- **Planned** — design exists, not yet coded
- **Not implemented** — out of scope or not started
